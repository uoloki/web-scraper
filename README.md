## Web Scraping Script Overview

This script is designed for extracting detailed product information from web pages. It utilizes the BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries to scrape data from specified URLs. While written for `https://scrapeme.live/shop/`, this script can be adapted to other e-commerce platforms.

### Core Features:
- **Data Extraction**: Retrieves product details such as names, prices, and image URLs.
- **Output**: Saves the scraped data into a CSV file.

### Installation
To get started with this script, you need to have Python installed on your system. Python 3.8 or higher is recommended. You will also need to install several dependencies:

!pip install beautifulsoup4 requests pandas Faker

### Usage
1. Basic Usage:
!python scraper.py
2. With Arguments:
!python scraper.py --time-limit 10 --page-limit 20

### Customization:
- The script is versatile and can be tailored to fit various marketplace websites. Adjustments can be made by modifying the regular expressions used for parsing and the `extract_product_data` function to match the specific HTML structure of other sites.

### Usage Recommendations:
- **IP Rotation**: To minimize the risk of IP blocking, it is advisable to use IP rotation software when making multiple requests.
- **Delay Mechanism**: Implementing a random sleep delay between requests can help avoid triggering anti-bot measures.

### Important Note:
Scraping data from websites should be done responsibly and ethically. Ensure that you comply with the legal requirements and terms of service of the websites parsed.
